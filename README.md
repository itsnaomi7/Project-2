# A QuoteA Day! 


I originally wanted to do a Mood Music app, but I'm doing a random quotes app instead now because of reasons...


# Motivation
- I thought it would be cute to add your own quote to a random list of quotes, and I thought of it when looking back at the to do list. Maybe a "to-do" can be to motivate yourself for the day.

# Tech used

HTML, CSS, Javascript, type-fit api

# Unresolved challenges:

- The new quote list is too short, and it wasn't at first but I changed something and couldn't figure out how to fix it. 
- I wanted to use another api with more specific quotes I personally wanted to see, but couldn't get it to work. So I want to go back and fix that.

# Stretch goals
I want to figure out how to make the background color change when the quotes change. I think I figured it out for solid colros but not this gradient color I have.
